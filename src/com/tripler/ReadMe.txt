Types of Design Patterns:
There are 23 design patterns which are classified in 3 categories

Creational Pattern:
  These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. 
This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.

Structural Pattern:
 These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces
and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

Behavioral Pattern:
These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

J2EE patterns(Additional by Sun Java):
   These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
